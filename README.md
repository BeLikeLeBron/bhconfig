# About this config
* Requires BH>=1.9.8 (planqi branch)
* Items are grouped into tiers based on relative worth. Worth is loosely defined as some combination of usefulness and rarity.
* Consistent colors are used to indicate the item tiers. The map box and item name indicator (leading 0) colors always match.
  - Tier1 (Orange): The good stuff. Sur, ber, jah, griff's, etc.
  - Tier2 (Purple): Vexes, ohms, arachs, high end socketables, etc.
  - Tier3 (Red): Tal armor, shako, etc.
  - Tier4 (Gold): Occy, titan's, vmagi, etc.
  - Tier5 (Green): Magefist, TO gloves, Tal belt, etc.
* Many useful shoppables are highlighted, including ladder reset stuff.
* Tries to ping every usable unique and set item. Useless ones are not hidden but will not ping.
* Tries to ping every useful socketable, including plague bases.
* Useful charged items are highlighted: life tap wands, lower resist wands, teleport staves
* The item filter works on an item by item basis. Only the junkiest stuff is hidden. Nothing is hidden with clvl<40. There is little risk that useful things are blocked by this filter.
* Does not attempt to judge the value of identified rare/crafted/magic items. Does ping unidentified rare/magic items worth IDing.
* Shows affix level on magic, rare, and crafted items when it is different from ilvl. The format is ilvl/alvl.
